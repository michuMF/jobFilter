This code is a simple job board that allows users to search for jobs by company, position, level, languages and tools. The code uses the Fetch API to retrieve data from a JSON file and then uses JavaScript to create a list of jobs and a search bar.
The index.html file uses the flex property to make the job board responsive.
The script.js file uses the fetch() method to fetch the data from the data.json file.
The script.js file uses the querySelector() method to select the list of jobs and the search bar.
The script.js file uses the addEventListener() method to add event listeners to the list of jobs and the search bar.
I hope this README is helpful. Please let me know if you have any other questions.
